# 🔐 Text & File Encryption Tool using Python

A simple Python-based encryption tool that lets you encrypt and decrypt both text and files using a custom key-based cipher.  
I built this project to understand how encryption works internally and to practice Python scripting, file handling, and cybersecurity fundamentals.

## 📘 Description

This tool performs reversible encryption using a user-defined key.  
It supports:

-  Text encryption  
-  Text decryption  
-  File encryption (images, PDFs, documents, videos, etc.)  
-  File decryption  
-  Easy, menu-driven CLI interface  
-  Pure Python — no external libraries required  

It is not designed for production-level security, but is great for learning how data transforms during encryption and decryption.
